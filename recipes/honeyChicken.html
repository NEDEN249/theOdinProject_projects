    <li>4 chicken breasts (about 600g), trimmed and cut into 2-3cm cubes</li>
    <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
    <li>40g piece of ginger, peeled and finely grated</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>

    <li>Â½-1 lemon, juiced</li>

    <li>cooked rice and steamed broccoli, to serve (optional)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Tip the chicken into a bowl, sprinkle over the flour and some seasoning and toss until the chicken is evenly coated.</li>
    <li>Combine the ginger, garlic, soy, honey and half the lemon juice in a bowl. Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok over a high heat and fry the chicken for 3-4 mins until lightly golden. Tip in the honey sauce and stir-fry for 10 mins, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon. Taste for seasoning and squeeze over the remaining lemon juice, if needed, then serve with rice and steamed broccoli, if you like.</li>
