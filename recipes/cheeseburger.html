    INGREDIENTS
</h1>
<ul>
    <li>minced beef</li>
    <li>300g breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>140g extra-mature or mature cheddar, grated</li>
    <li>4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 small bunch parsley, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>split burger buns</li>
    <li>sliced tomatoes</li>
    <li>red onion slices</li>
    <li>lettuce, tomato sauce, coleslaw, wedges or fries</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Crumble the mince in a large bowl, then tip in the breadcrumbs, cheese, Worcestershire sauce, parsley and eggs with 1 tsp ground pepper and 1-2 tsp salt. Mix with your hands to combine everything thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Combine the ginger, garlic, soy, honey and half the lemon juice in a bowl. Heat the oil in a large frying pan or wok over a high heat and fry the chicken for 3-4 mins until lightly golden. Tip in the honey sauce and stir-fry for 10 mins, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon. Taste for seasoning and squeeze over the remaining lemon juice, if needed, then serve with rice and steamed broccoli, if you like.</li>
    <li>To cook the burgers, heat grill to high. Grill burgers for 6-8 mins on each side until cooked through. Meanwhile, warm as many buns as you need in a foil-covered tray below the grilling burgers. Let everyone assemble their own, served with their favourite accompaniments.</li>
