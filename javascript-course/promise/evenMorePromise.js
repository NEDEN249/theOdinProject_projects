    //.then(fun2, onError) -> then it won't stop the following functions from running which is most likely not what we want
    //depending on if fun2 returns resolve or reject will determine whether .then or .catch
    //however, .catch could be run when the first .reject is run whenever that is -> in this case straight after fun1!!! unless we changed that reject to resolve
    .then(onSuccess) 
    .catch(onError) //having a global catch is likely the best solution to this problem
    .finally(inTheEnd) //an optional thing to pass into the chain, will run regardless of whether the promise is resolved or rejected (so even when a .catch is done)
